      journeys starting or ending somewhere in the neighbourhood, just routes that
      pass through without stopping. These are shown in shades of red; the white
      streets are dead-ends and cul-de-sacs; a driver has no reason to go there unless
      their trip starts or ends there. The darkest reds show the streets most likely

      real traffic patterns in the larger area. Maybe the northern boundary of
      this neighbourhood isn’t attractive for drivers, because there’s no reason
      to drive that way. (In this case, since the neighbourhood is just north of
      Aberdeen city centre and the north/south shortcut is parallel to an A
      road, it <strong>is</strong> likely a shortcut that happens in practice.)
      The tool’s assumptions are necessary to make due to a lack of detailed
      traffic pattern data, and because they can be calculated even as you start
      to edit the neighbourhood. The shortcuts simply show what is
      <strong>possible</strong> for drivers to do, not what is likely. You may need

      a shortcut is actually a problem in practice.`,Rn=a(),Ke=s("h3"),Ke.textContent="Editing: modal filters",Zn=a(),Ht=s("p"),Ht.innerHTML=`Now that you understand shortcuts, let’s move on to the interventions you
      can propose to fix these problems. The main tool is the <strong>modal filter</strong>, or point closure. It stops drivers from passing through a street, while
      still allowing pedestrians and cyclists (and sometimes buses, emergency
      vehicles, etc) through. Let’s try adding a modal filter along the
      north/south shortcut:`,$n=a(),ce=s("img"),to=a(),It=s("p"),It.textContent=`Immediately after you click to add the filter, you’ll see the red

      pass through. You can use the different types to communicate more specific
      proposals. School streets are timed closures, but the tool will model the
      effects of the filter during school hours. When you place a filter on a
      street that currently has a bus route along it, you will automatically get
      a bus gate, which uses camera enforcement and doesn’t physically prevent
      vehicles from crossing. The specifics of the physical intervention are
      outside the scope of this tool – depending on width constraints, allowing
      adequate room for bin lorries to turn, and so on, the physical
      implementation of a filter could be a pocket park, removable bollards,
      concrete, etc. The LTN tool’s purpose is to focus on the strategic

      to handle through-traffic, and so the tool does not calculate shortcuts
      along main roads, and the cells are determined by connections to main
      roads. In the example below, there are main roads surrounding the
      perimeter of the neighbourhood, which is typical, but there are also two
      north/south main roads in the middle, causing there to be cells on each

      street with heavy foot and cycling traffic. No matter the reason, you can
      mark new main roads or erase main roads using one of the tools. After

      stays on main roads, which have higher speed limits, but during heavy
      traffic, drivers are more likely to divert through a neighbourhood street.

      the change in journey times starting from everywhere in the neighbourhood

      journeys begin and end. The LTN tool’s impact prediction mode calculates
