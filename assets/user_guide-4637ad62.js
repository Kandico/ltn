      neighbourhood. <strong>Shortcuts</strong> show the possible routes through
      a neighbourhood a driver might take when avoiding main roads. They do not include
      journeys starting or ending somewhere in the neighbourhood, just routes that
      pass through without stopping. These are shown in shades of red; the white
      streets are dead-ends and cul-de-sacs; a driver has no reason to go there unless
      their trip starts or ends there. The darkest reds show the streets most likely
      to see lots of traffic cutting through. The darkest red is along the long north/south
      street:`,Jn=a(),ae=s("img"),Vn=a(),Tt=s("p"),Tt.textContent=`To understand why, you can use the Shortcuts tool at the top. If we
      inspect this street, we see one example shortcut from north to south:`,Wn=a(),le=s("img"),Gn=a(),Ct=s("p"),Ct.textContent=`The tool identifies 51 different shortcuts passing through this one
      street, showing the most advantageous shortcuts first – the ones that save
      the driver the most time by cutting through the middle of the
      neighbourhood. Most of the shortcuts are simple variations, changing the
      exact entrance or exit. There are also some shortcuts involving the
      western boundary:`,Qn=a(),re=s("img"),Rn=a(),Lt=s("p"),Lt.textContent="The tool counts these shortcuts in a simple way:",Zn=a(),Ht=s("ol"),Ht.innerHTML=`<li>Find all entrances and exits onto streets from the main roads</li> <li>For every combination, calculate the fastest driving route, using the

      neighbourhood through any point, but of course this doesn’t reflect the
      real traffic patterns in the larger area. Maybe the northern boundary of
      this neighbourhood isn’t attractive for drivers, because there’s no reason
      to drive that way. (In this case, since the neighbourhood is just north of
      Aberdeen city centre and the north/south shortcut is parallel to an A
      road, it <strong>is</strong> likely a shortcut that happens in practice.)
      The tool’s assumptions are necessary to make due to a lack of detailed
      traffic pattern data, and because they can be calculated even as you start
      to edit the neighbourhood. The shortcuts simply show what is
      <strong>possible</strong> for drivers to do, not what is likely. You may need
      to apply your own local knowledge, judgment, or traffic counters to verify
      a shortcut is actually a problem in practice.`,eo=a(),Ke=s("h3"),Ke.textContent="Editing: modal filters",to=a(),jt=s("p"),jt.innerHTML=`Now that you understand shortcuts, let’s move on to the interventions you
      can propose to fix these problems. The main tool is the <strong>modal filter</strong>, or point closure. It stops drivers from passing through a street, while
      still allowing pedestrians and cyclists (and sometimes buses, emergency
      vehicles, etc) through. Let’s try adding a modal filter along the
      north/south shortcut:`,no=a(),ce=s("img"),io=a(),St=s("p"),St.textContent=`Immediately after you click to add the filter, you’ll see the red
      shortcuts jump to the right, zig-zagging to avoid the new filter. If you
      add a second filter there, you’ll see a big change:`,so=a(),he=s("img"),lo=a(),At=s("p"),At.textContent=`The blue cell has been split into a new yellow cell, making it clear that
      now the north/south shortcut is totally impossible.`,ro=a(),Mt=s("p"),Mt.textContent=`You may have noticed the modal filter icons on the map are different.
      There are four types you can choose from:`,co=a(),ue=s("img"),uo=a(),Nt=s("p"),Nt.textContent=`In the scope of the tool, these all mean the same thing – a driver cannot
      pass through. You can use the different types to communicate more specific
      proposals. School streets are timed closures, but the tool will model the
      effects of the filter during school hours. When you place a filter on a
      street that currently has a bus route along it, you will automatically get
      a bus gate, which uses camera enforcement and doesn’t physically prevent
      vehicles from crossing. The specifics of the physical intervention are
      outside the scope of this tool – depending on width constraints, allowing
      adequate room for bin lorries to turn, and so on, the physical
      implementation of a filter could be a pocket park, removable bollards,
      concrete, etc. The LTN tool’s purpose is to focus on the strategic
      planning.`,fo=a(),Ve=s("h3"),Ve.textContent="Editing: diagonal modal filters",go=a(),Et=s("p"),Et.textContent=`Modal filters usually apply at one point along a street, but when you have

      count as <strong>main roads</strong>, shown in grey. The initial
      classification is taken from OpenStreetMap data. Main roads are intended
      to handle through-traffic, and so the tool does not calculate shortcuts
      along main roads, and the cells are determined by connections to main
      roads. In the example below, there are main roads surrounding the
      perimeter of the neighbourhood, which is typical, but there are also two
      north/south main roads in the middle, causing there to be cells on each
      side.`,So=a(),me=s("img"),Mo=a(),Pt=s("p"),Pt.innerHTML=`You may want to reclassify these main roads, and treat them like

      street with heavy foot and cycling traffic. No matter the reason, you can
      mark new main roads or erase main roads using one of the tools. In complex
      areas, it may be simplest to first <i>Erase all main roads</i> and then
      <i>Mark as main along a route</i>. After removing those two interior main
      roads, the neighbourhood looks like one big cell:`,No=a(),pe=s("img"),zo=a(),Dt=s("p"),Dt.textContent=`You can now make other edits and see the effects on cells and shortcuts

      route before any changes you’ve made, and the blue line shows the new
      route accounting for your new modal filters, one-ways, and turn

      assumptions that drivers travel at the full speed limit, with no delays at

      stays on main roads, which have higher speed limits, but during heavy
      traffic, drivers are more likely to divert through a neighbourhood street.

      spillover effects, we need to understand the overall patterns of traffic
      in the wider study area. Origin/destination datasets describe where
      journeys begin and end. The LTN tool’s impact prediction mode calculates
